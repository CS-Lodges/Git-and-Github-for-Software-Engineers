# Github Commands
- `rm -rf .git` is used to remove the git folder
- you can simply delete the git folder from your PC to remove it.
- Once remote Location is added you can simply use push command to work directly!
- you need to add the remote repository only once!
- `.gitignore` is the file where you keep the names of those files you want git to ignore!
- `*.extensionName` if included in the gitignore folder then all those files will be ignored!
- `git diff` compares the working area and stagging area

- `git commit -a -m "direct commit" ` It will directly commit the tracked files (the already staged file). however the untracked files will not be committed!
- `git log` will display all the commits and who commit them also! by pressing `q` you will be out of git log command.
-  You can manually delete or rename files from the git repo but it can be done using git bash!
- `git rm fileName.ExtensionName` file will be deleted from the git repo and it will also be staged . The next step will be to commit! When you do this manually it is not staged!
- `git mv currentFileName.ExtensionName newFileName.ExtensionName` file will be renamed and it will be staged as well. The next step will be to commit! When you do this manually it is not staged!
